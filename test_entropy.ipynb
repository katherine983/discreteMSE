    "The following notebook demonstrates the implementations of Approximate Entropy and Sample Entropy in the discreteMSE package. These implementations are specific for use on discrete valued time series where the filter parameter, r, is suppressed and only exact vector matches are counted. The demonstration is divided into four sections:  \n",
    "1. [Section 1](#Section1) provides a review of Approximate Entropy  \n",
    "2. [Section 2](#Section2) provides a review of Sample Entropy\n",
    "3. [Section 3](#Section3) describes the changes to the ApEn and SampEn algorithms for discrete data\n",
    "4. [Section 4](#Section4) reviews the implementation of discrete Apen and SampEn in the discreteMSE.entropy module\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: In this demonstration, all discussion of indexing or elements at index i assumes a series or sequence indexed at 1 for the first element, as opposed to the Python indexing convention which starts at i=0. This means that some of the indexing used in the Python code blocks will not align completely with that used in the text. Therefore when the range $1 \\leq i \\leq N-m$ is given in the text below, this is equivalent to the range $0 \\leq i \\leq N-m-1$ in Python indexing.*"

    "### Considerations when using ApEn\n",
    "ApEn is not intended to be an estimate of the true entropy rate or K-S entropy of a sequence but rather Pincus asserts it should be regarded as a family of statistics measuring the degree of sequence regularity[1](#1), [4](#4). While the Shannon entropy rate and K-S entropy are designed to estimate the average rate of information gain as $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, ApEn was designed to be used to study the evolution of a system’s complexity over time [4](#4) and compare the irregularity of finite, short sequences (*N*=1000). For ApEn to be valid, Pincus and Goldberger recommend data with at least $N=10m$  data points. However, ApEn is biased for shorter sequences because it includes self-counting when tabulating vector matches. This produces an overestimation of the regularity in the sequence because vectors which only match themselves for m+1 points, will contribute a value of ln(1/1)=0 to the sum, thus skewing the ApEn value towards 0 implying regularity, even though, intuitively, having a large number of vectors which only match themselves should equate to higher irregularity [3](#3). Sample Entropy (SampEn) aims to rectify this bias. "

    "Richman and Moorman [3](#3) introduced SampEn as an alternative to the ApEn formula that reduces the amount of bias in the sequence regularity estimate. First, similarly to the ApEn algorithmic simplification, SampEn excludes the *m*-length vector at index *N-m+1*, thus ensuring there are corresponding $x_m(i)$ and $x_{m+1}(i)$ for all $i, 1 \\leq i \\leq N-m$. Second, SampEn does not include self-matches in the tabulation of $B_i$ and $A_i$. Finally, while ApEn takes the negative sum of the logarithm of each $A_i/B_i$ ratio for $1 \\leq i \\leq N-m$, SampEn takes the logarithm of the ratio of the total number of *m+1*-length vector matches to the total number of *m*-length vector matches.
